## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.4] - 2025-04-05

### Added

- Add method `Config.replace_version_config`
- Configure variables from the `findings add` TUI

### Changed

- Update error messages for Jinja2 missing variables


### Fixed

- Fix mismatch in the attached source archive name when embedding the archive vs. unpacking.

## [0.2.3] - 2025-04-02

### Changed

- Validate variables for sub-findings if the corresponding template can be found.
- Print error if variable is missing for Jinja2 (optional variables now need to stricly check with `is defined`)

## [0.2.2] - 2025-04-01

### Added

- Add `py.typed` file to the package to indicate that it supports type hints.

### Changed

- Allow constructing `SeretoDate` from string with a custom format string

### Fixed

- Check if there is any target before opening TUI to add findings
- Make `load_plugins` function print name of missing plugin module

### Dependencies

- Update pypdf requirement from ~=5.3.0 to ~=5.4.0
- Update textual requirement from ~=2.1.1 to ~=3.0.0
- Update rich requirement from ~=13.9.2 to ~=14.0.0
- Update pydantic requirement from ~=2.10.1 to ~=2.11.1

## [0.2.1] - 2025-03-10

### Changed

- Add fallback keyring backend (keyring-alt) to support Docker and WSL.
- Fork `click-repl` and build release from master.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-26

### Added

- TUI utility for fuzzy searching and adding findings to the report (`sereto findings add`).

### Changed
- **Major refactoring**: separated runtime classes from Pydantic models to better distinguish operational logic from data loading and validation.
- The entire target subtree is now version-specific; for retests, copy the subtree from the previous version.
- Migrated from findings.yaml to findings.toml.
- Updated how risk counts are represented.
- Used more explicit function arguments.
- Revised unique name generation.
- Improved `VersionConfig.filter_dates`.
- Fixed REPL UsageError (requires removing `click-repl` 0.3.0 if installed).

## [0.1.1] - 2025-02-02

### Changed

- Docs: `uv` as preferred package manager for installation.
- `sereto findings add`: Allow adding findings from other categories.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-22

### Added

- Introduce plugin system for adding new commands to the CLI.
- Add CLI commands: `sereto pdf target`, `sereto pdf finding-group` to render partial reports.
- `Render`: add methods for selecting recipe

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Implement new directory structure for the project.
- **Breaking:** Rename "informational" risk to "info".
- **Breaking:** Add `version_description` attribute to `VersionConfig`.
- **Breaking:** `ConvertRecipe` now has in addition to input_format also output_format.
- Command `sereto pdf report` no longer renders the partial reports.

### Fixed

- Fix target index in `delete_targets_config`
- Set correct indexes for partials (target, finding group)
- Fix path to template when reading metadata
- Fix the issue with internal links inside PDF being broken after running `embed_source_archive`

### Removed

- Remove `argon2-cffi` dependency. This was added to the `crytography` library in version 44.0.0.

## [0.0.17] - 2024-11-29

### Added

- Docs: Markdown building blocks (writing findings and their templates).
- Jinja2: add debug extension to generic env.
- REPL: Add `exit` command + `debug` command to toggle debug mode. Show debug mode indicator in the prompt.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Modify the structure of `config.json`.
- Update REPL to use `click-repl`.
- Remove redundancy in Jinja2 rendering.
- Adjust variables passed when rendering Jinja templates.
- Use `prompt_toolkit` for user input.
- Make the default TeX rendering less verbose + fail early.
- Remove command output during rendering. We might still need to show the errors in the future.
- Display command execution time.
- `Config.filter_*` methods now contain parameter `invert`, which allows to invert the filtering logic.
- Avoid overriding TeX files if the content was not changed. This should speed up the rendering process as `latexmk` uses the file modification time to decide whether to recompile the document.

### Fixed

- Fix `Config.filter_*` methods to handle correctly None values.

## [0.0.16] - 2024-10-28

### Added

- Provide helper methods to `VersionConfig` for writing the templates - `filter_targets`, `filter_dates`, and `filter_people`
- Docs: start documenting available building blocks for writing the templates

### Changed

- Use NamedTuple to represent result of key derivation with Argon2
- Use Pydantic's Secret types when dealing with passwords. This prevents the data from being printed in the logs and tracebacks.
- Rename `BaseConfig` class to `VersionConfig`
- Implement `__str__` method for `Date` class
- Make sure the source archive always starts with the directory equal to the project ID, even if the user renamed the directory
- Handle more edge cases when extracting the source archive

### Fixed

- Fix `sereto ls` failing when there is a file in the report directory (too strict argument check in `Project.is_project_dir` function).
- Fix unpacking unencrypted source archive.

### Security

- Use filter [data](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile.data_filter) when extracting the source archive from tar. This takes care of the following:
    - Strip leading slashes (`/` and `os.sep`) from filenames.
    - Refuse to extract files with absolute paths (in case the name is absolute even after stripping slashes, e.g. `C:/foo` on Windows).
    - Refuse to extract files whose absolute path (after following symlinks) would end up outside the destination.
    - Clear high mode bits (setuid, setgid, sticky) and group/other write bits (`S_IWGRP` | `S_IWOTH`).
    - Refuse to extract links (hard or soft) that link to absolute paths, or ones that link outside the destination.
    - Refuse to extract device files (including pipes).
    - For regular files, including hard links:
        - Set the owner read and write permissions (`S_IRUSR` | `S_IWUSR`).
        - Remove the group & other executable permission (`S_IXGRP` | `S_IXOTH`) if the owner doesnâ€™t have it (`S_IXUSR`).
    - For other files (directories), set `mode` to `None`, so that extraction methods skip applying permission bits.
    - Set user and group info (`uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`) to `None`, so that extraction methods skip setting it.

## [0.0.15] - 2024-10-21

### Changed

- Use `TypeAdapter` instead of `RootModel` in config module.
- Type hints: start using Self
- README: rebranding IT Hub -> Digital Hub
- Improve error message for `Config` and `Settings` validation

- Refactor: `FindingsConfig.from_yaml_file` -> `FindingsConfig.from_yaml`
- Refactor: fn `write_conifg` -> `Config.dump_json`
- Refactor class `Report` to `Project`, which now contains also `settings` and `path` attributes
- Refactor: `Project.load_runtime_vars` -> `Config.update_paths`
- Refactor: `Project.is_report_dir` -> `Project.is_project_dir`
- Refactor: fn `extract_source_archive` -> `retrieve_source_archive`
- Refactor: fn `untar_sources` -> `extract_source_archive`
- Move `config` module into `cli`, as it contains only CLI related functions
