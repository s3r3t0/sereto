# Security Considerations

Before you start using this tool, please consider the following:

## Write access to settings file

The global [settings](../concepts/settings.md) file contains the commands that are executed during the rendering process. It is important to note that if an attacker gains write access to this file, they can execute arbitrary commands on your machine, potentially compromising its security.

For standard installations, this should not be a concern.


*Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.*
